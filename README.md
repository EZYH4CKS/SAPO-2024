# SAPO-2024
My attempt at the South African Programming Olympiad during 2024. I was only in 12th Grade so be mindful of mistakes in syntax and/or bad coding LOL. I did not do as well as I'd like because I did the Programming Olympiad right after I finished my 3 hour coding exam for school... The time contraint was 1 hour. I only managed to score 250/500 since I was a little too tired...
