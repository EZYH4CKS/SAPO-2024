# SAPO-2024
My attempt at the South African Programming Olympiad during 2024. I was only in 12th Grade so be mindful of mistakes in syntax and/or bad coding LOL. 

I did not do as well as I would have hoped because I did the Programming Olympiad right after I finished my 3 hour coding exam for school... I only managed to score 250/500 since I was a little too tired...

**Time constraint: 1 hour**

**My Final Score: 250/500 (50%)**
